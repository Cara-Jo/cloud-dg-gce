=== Deprovisioning

Deprovisioning can be done via the command line or the web UI.  To use the console type the command:

----
gcloud deployment-manager deployments delete ben1
----

Running from the command line, I see the following output;

To delete the deployment in the web UI, click the trash can icon on the "Deployment Manager" page as show below:
