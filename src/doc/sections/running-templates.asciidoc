=== Running the Templates

==== Create a Deployment

We're going to start of by creating a new deployment.  I'm going to call mine ben1.  To create it, I'm going to enter the command:

----
./deploy.sh ben1
----

When I do that, I see the following output:

At this point, the physical resources on GCE have all provisioned.  However, each machine has a script that runs and installs Java as well as provisioning DSE.  That will take another few minutes to run.

==== Inspecting the Output

The easiest way to inspect output is in the web interface.  You can access this at http://cloud.google.com  Once logged in, click on "my console."  If you click the three horizontal lines in the upper left and scroll down, you should see an option under "Tools" titled "Deployment Manager."  Select that and expand the tree for your deployment.

The opscenter-datastax-vm is the machine running our instance of OpsCenter.  I'm going to click "More about this resource."

Scolling down, I see the external ip for the OpsCenter machine.  Enter that IP into your url bar and add ":8888" to access OpsCenter on port 8888.  If you do this relatively quickly after deployment, you may see a "Build in Progress" screen like below:

We have observed intermittent errors with the OpsCenter provision.  At this time, our best solution is to delete the deployment and try again.  We are working to increase reliability and add retries.

If the cluster build completes successfully, you should see the following if you used clusterParameters.small.yaml as input:

If you used clusterParameters.large.yaml as input, you should see this:

At this point you have a running DSE cluster!  You can ssh into it using Google ssh console and begin working with DSE.
