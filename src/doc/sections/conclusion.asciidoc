This document covers tha basics of getting up and running with DataStax Entperprise in GCE. The OpsCenter based deployment shown here does not include rack awareness. Production deployments should use GCE zones to implement rack awareness and GCE regions to implement data centers. Instructions on how to install and configure DSE for more complex topologies can be found here: http://docs.datastax.com/en/datastax_enterprise/4.8/datastax_enterprise/install/installTOC.html
