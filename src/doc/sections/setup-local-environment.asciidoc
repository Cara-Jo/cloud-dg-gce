=== Setup Local Environment

==== Prerequisites

Obtain a GCE account:: Follow https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/signup[Google's instructions] to get set up with an account and to activate cloud access. Note that Google offers a https://console.developers.google.com/freetrial[free trial] for new users.

Get the tools:: The scripts in this document rely on the https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute/[gcloud] command line tool.

.Install gcloud on Mac or Linux
[source,bash]
----
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
gcloud components update
----

To install gcloud on windows, follow https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute/#install[these instructions].

Detailed instructions for using gcloud to interact with GCE compute resources can be found here: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute/

Create an authentication token:: GCE uses OAuth tokens to manage resource authentication. Logging in is generally as simple as running `gcloud auth login` but if problems are encountered, follow https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute/#auth [these more detailed instructions] to establish the authentication tokens.

Log in to the console:: Despite the fact that the commands in this guide use the command line interface, the Google cloud console is still a very useful resource to use while running a cluster. Many of the administrative actions that can be performed in the console will also provide the equivalent command line invocation, which can be a very useful way to learn the gcloud tool. Log in to your console at: https://console.developers.google.com/

Create a project (optional):: Use the console to create a project for the DataStax Enterprise deployment. Click the create project button and assign a useful name, this guide will use the name "myproject". The project-id field has to be globally unique, so it is convenient to use the suggestion provided by the tool, but it is possible to specify it manually.

After creating the project, set it as the default project that gcloud will use for all commands.

.Set the default project
[source,bash]
----
gcloud config set project myproject
----
